# The Skellin

A race of grim-looking humanoids.
While their thin skin and brittle bones means they can't take much of a beating, their dexterity allows them to get out a number of shots before they can be taken down.
Because of these adaptations, they excel at taking out single targets, providing them plenty of opportunity as hitmen.

# Toxic Flu

Skellins are not affected by toxic buildup, instead developing a condition known as "toxic flu".
In some ways, toxic flu is more like an allergic reaction. It supresses the victim's immune system and interferes with their senses.
At higher severities, however, it can cause abnormal behavior, ranging from confusion to extreme anger.

# Toxic Fever

By isolating certain compounds, toxic flu can be replaced by a condition known as "toxic fever".
Toxic fever is a drug-like condition, which increases most capacities.
Unlike most drugs, there is no risk of addiction or chemical damage. The behavioral effects, however, are still a risk.

# Weapons

These weapons have been balanced for use by Skellins

The Juror: A revolver designed to fire shells, often used for self-defense. Its short barrel makes it terribly inaccurate at medium-long range.

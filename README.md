A race for RimWorld
Made with Humanoid Alien Races

A race a grim-looking humanoids.
While their thin skin and brittle bones means they can't take much of a beating, their dexterity allows them to get out a number of shots before they can be taken down.
Because of these adaptations, they excel at taking out single targets, providing them plenty of opportunity as hitmen.

# The Skellin

A race of grim-looking humanoids.
While their thin skin and brittle bones means they can't take much of a beating, their dexterity allows them to get out a number of shots before they can be taken down.
Because of these adaptations, they excel at taking out single targets, providing them plenty of opportunity as hitmen.

# Toxic Hangover

Skellins are not affected by toxic buildup, instead developing a condition known as "toxic hangover".
In some ways, toxic hangover is more like an allergic reaction. It supresses the victim's immune system and interferes with their senses.
At higher severities, however, it can cause abnormal behavior, ranging from confusion to extreme anger.

# Weapons

These weapons have been balanced for use by Skellins

The Juror: A revolver designed to fire shells, often used for self-defense. Its short barrel makes it terribly inaccurate at medium-long range.
